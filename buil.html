      <h1>Building Construction</h1>

    <p>
        Building Construction, the techniques and industry involved in the assembly and erection of structures, primarily those 
        
        used to provide shelter.

Construction is an ancient human activity. It began with the purely functional need for a controlled environment to moderate the 
effects of climate. Constructed shelters were one means by which human beings were able to adapt themselves to a wide variety of climates and become a global species.

Human shelters were at first very simple and perhaps lasted only a few days or months. Over time, however, even temporary
 structures evolved into such highly refined forms as the igloo. Gradually more durable structures began to appear, particularly 
 after the advent of agriculture, when people began to stay in one place for long periods. The first shelters were dwellings, but 
 later other functions, such as food storage and ceremony, were housed in separate buildings. Some structures began to have symbolic
  as well as functional value, marking the beginning of the distinction between architecture and building.

The history of building is marked by a number of trends. One is the increasing durability of the materials used. Early building 
materials were perishable, such as leaves, branches, and animal hides. Later, more durable natural materials—such as clay, 
stone, and timber—and, finally, synthetic materials—such as brick, concrete, metals, and plastics—were used. Another is a quest
 for buildings of ever greater height and span; this was made possible by the development of stronger materials and by knowledge 
 of how materials behave and how to exploit them to greater advantage.

      The term is a broad and generic one and most construction workers are primarily described by the specific level and 
      type of work they perform. Laborers comprise a large grouping in most national construction industries. In the United
       States, for example, in May 2021 the construction sector employed just over 7.5 million people, of whom just over
        820,000 were laborers, while 573,000 were carpenters, 508,000 were electricians, 258,000 were equipment operators 
        and 230,000 were construction managers.[4] Like most business sectors, there is also substantial white-collar 
        employment in construction - 681,000 US workers were recorded by the United States Department of Labor as in 
        'office and administrative support occupations' in May 2021.[5] In 2023 the United States reported that, of the 
        total number of construction workers, 27.7% of workers were Hispanic and around 6.2% were women.
        In 2008, a Human Rights Watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions in China and a failure on 
        the part of the government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry.[10] The International Labour 
        Organization (ILO) estimated that, at the end of 2006, 90% of the 40 million construction workers in China were
         migrant workers. Many turned to work after their farming communities collapsed into poverty.
         Workers are those most at risk of injury and ill health on a construction project. Because they are in a good
          position to recognise risks, they can help those they are working for to establish ways in which the work can be 
          carried out safely and without risk to health. Workers must report anything they see that is likely to endanger 
          either their own or others health and safety.Workers must have the skills, knowledge, training and experience 
          (SKTE) to do the work that they have been employed to do, or be in the process of obtaining them. If they do not 
          have the full range of SKTE, their employer, or whoever is in control of them, must provide them with the training 
          and supervision that enables them to carry out their work safely and without risk to health.

          In assessing whether they have the SKTE, workers should not rely on industry certification cards or similar as the only evidence that they have the right qualities for a particular job. Nationally recognised qualifications (such as NVQs and SVQs) can provide potential employers with evidence that a worker has the SKTE to carry out the tasks to do a particular job.

Workers must be consulted by their employers, or whoever is in control of their work, about matters which affect their health, safety and welfare.
